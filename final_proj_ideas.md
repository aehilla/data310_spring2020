Problem Statement:

Problem Statement that introduces your selected topic, identifies significant goals associated with the implementation of your applied machine learning method, demonstrates why your problem is important, and describes and analyzes the complex nature of your problem including any process oriented causes and effects. Conclude your problem statement with a stated central research question. You are welcome to articulate a central research question in broad and general terms, given the abbreviated time frame for this investigation.

Research Question:

What is the effect of urban sprawl on air temperature over time in the Solomon Islands?

I chose the Solomon Islands because I wanted to examine a country that was urbanizing rapidly, but which was not too large and difficult to analyze. Uganda has the fastest urbanization rate of any country currently, with an urbanization rate of 5.7% as of 2020. However, Uganda is very large and populous, with 45 million people across 236,040 square kilometers. The Solomon Islands have a much more managable geographic size and population, with just 652,857 people across 28,400 square kilometers. However, it still has a very high urbanization rate of 3.91%, putting it in the top 30 fastest urbanizing countries, and its rising economic potential is often overlooked due to its small size.
