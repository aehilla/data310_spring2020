## Updated response using home prices model with three variables

The updated script I made to predict housing price predicts based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. 

This 3-variable model predicts prices (in 100k) of:
3.96 for church
1.6499 for hudgins
3.076 for mathews
3.09299 for mobjack
1.578 for moon
2.6679 for new point comfort

|Church| 3.99      | 3.96      |
|Hudgins| .97      | 1.649       |
|Mathews| 3.475   | 3.076      |
