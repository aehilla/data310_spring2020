## Updated response using home prices model with three variables

The updated script I made to predict housing price predicts based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. 

This 3-variable model predicts prices (in 100k) of:

|Name | Actual      | Predicted | Deal|
|-----| ----------- | ----------- |----|
|Church| 3.99      | 3.96      | Fair deal|
|Hudgins| .97      | 1.649       | Good deal|
|Mathews| 3.475   | 3.076      | Bad deal |
|Mobjack| 2.890   | 3.092        | Good deal|
|Moon| 2.500  | 1.578        | Bad deal|
|New Pt. Comfort| 2.290   | 2.667        |Good deal|
